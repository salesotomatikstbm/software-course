margin auto how/when/where do we teach them ?

for the menu ul li flex how/when/where do we teach them ?

for the fontawesome icons how/when/where do we teach them ?

we need to have proper hint to the project for the students to learn

if required we should give boiler plate code and step by step instruction to build this

we should guide them for few items like navigation bar, etc

we should also guide them to get the skeleton

we should prompt them as what do they see and ask them jot down their observation

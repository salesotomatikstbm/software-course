I am creating a step by step procedure for students to build a web page.
the below content details it out. create an html page, make it minimalistic and elegent. use boostrap for styling
whereever we have question, hints, action - use appropriate styling
wherever there is a view, embed that as an iframe with an option to open the page in a new window
the text i have given in question, hints , action are just pointers, you can rephrase it in simple english for the students to understand

create the web page layout such that in the left side there is a collapsible nav bar

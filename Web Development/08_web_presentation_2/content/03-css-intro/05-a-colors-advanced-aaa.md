### The Color Wheel  
The color wheel shows how colors relate to each other.

- **Complementary Colors**: Colors opposite each other on the wheel (like red and green). They create strong contrast.
- **Analogous Colors**: Colors next to each other on the wheel (like blue, cyan, and green). They match well.

### How Colors Affect Us  

Colors can change how we feel:  
- **Red** can make us feel excited or alert.  
- **Blue** can be calm and peaceful.  
- **Yellow** is happy and bright.  

Designers use this in art, websites, and advertisements.

### Transparency â€” RGBA Colors  
You can add transparency with `rgba()`. The `a` stands for alpha, and you set how see-through the color is.

Example:  
```css
rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5) /* 50% transparent red */
```
